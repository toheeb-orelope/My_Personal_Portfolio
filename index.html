    <div class="detailsAbout">
        <p>Hi, I'm Toheeb, a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Northampton. While I've always had a deep interest in technology, it wasn’t until I discovered the world of cybersecurity that my true passion took shape. The challenge of protecting data against ever-evolving cyber threats excites me, as it combines both creativity and critical thinking. I’m fascinated by how securing digital systems can reshape our world, safeguard privacy, and drive efficiency in every industry. I’m eager to continue growing in this field, exploring innovative ways to build a safer, more secure digital future.</p>
        <p>When I'm not deep into cybersecurity or coding my latest projects, I’m exploring mini projects in iOS development. There's something thrilling about watching code come to life—those real-world implementations that bring everything together, making all the effort and complexity of programming feel worthwhile.</p>

                <p>
                    I'm fascinated by the more cutting-edge, almost futuristic aspects of cybersecurity. Some of the mind-bending concepts that keep me up at night include:
                </p>
                <ul> 
                    <li>The rise of quantum computing - how will it break current encryption methods, and what defenses will we need to develop?</li> 
                    <li>The potential of AI in cybersecurity - could AI-driven defenses predict and counter cyberattacks before they happen?</li>
                    <li>The future of zero-trust architecture - will we move toward a world where no system or user is automatically trusted?</li>
                    <li>The evolution of cyber warfare - how might nation-states use advanced cyber tools to wage war in the digital domain?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These ideas might sound like science fiction, but they’re increasingly becoming subjects of serious academic and ethical debate and research. They fuel my passion for cybersecurity and keep me eager to learn more every day.                </p>

                <div class="projectDetails">
                    <p> During my first year and first semester at the University of Northampton studying Software
                        Engineering, one of the
                        modules focused on imparting the significance of software engineering in real-world scenarios. This
                        encompassed various stages such as problem identification, eliciting characteristics of the problem
                        domain, specifying requirements, conducting system analysis, designing systems, building and testing
                        them, evaluating their performance, implementing them, and ensuring their maintenance. These
                        components constitute the fundamental aspects of software engineering. <br><br>
    
                        Under the guidance of exceptional lecturers, we were divided into subgroups and tasked with a
                        project aimed at addressing the decline in annual revenue at a zoo, attributed to outdated
                        technology. As the leader of the web development team, I collaborated closely with my team leader.
                        Despite our team's commendable performance, we unfortunately lost the contract due to our higher
                        pricing. Nonetheless, I take immense pride in our team's achievements and the high praise we
                        received from our lecturer, resulting in an A+ grade for my exemplary work ethic and
                        performance.<br><br>
    
                        I cannot overstate the incredible support provided by our lecturer, both in terms of delivering
                        lectures and offering additional assistance outside the classroom, ensuring that all students were
                        well-equipped for success.</p>
                        <strong id="leaderDesign">Design Lead for Website Development</strong>
                        <p>As the Design Lead for our project, I spearheaded the design department in creating the initial website framework prior to implementation. Utilizing tools like Figma and Draw.io, I guided our team through a structured design process to ensure a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.</p>
                    <p>Key Responsibilities</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spearheading the development of core functionalities including coursework summarization, interactive Q&A, extended reading suggestions, and content simplification.</li>
                        <li>Collaborative Design Process: I facilitated brainstorming sessions with team members to gather insights and ideas, ensuring that our design reflected the needs of both the zoo and its visitors.</li>
                        <li>Wireframing and Prototyping: Using Figma, I developed detailed wireframes and interactive prototypes, allowing stakeholders to visualize the layout and functionality of the website before development began. This iterative process helped us refine our ideas and improve usability based on feedback.</li>
                        <li>Flowcharts and Diagrams: I utilized Draw.io to create flowcharts and diagrams that outlined user journeys and interactions. These visual aids were instrumental in clarifying the site's structure and ensuring that all team members were aligned on the project goals.</li>
                        <li>Design Guidelines: I established a set of design guidelines that emphasized consistency, accessibility, and responsiveness across different devices. This ensured that the final product would meet modern web standards and provide an optimal experience for users.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Through effective leadership and collaboration, we successfully designed a website framework that serves as a robust foundation for the zoo’s digital presence. This proactive approach allowed for a smoother implementation phase, ultimately leading to a user-centric website that enhances engagement and interaction with visitors.

                        In my first year, second semester at the University of Northampton, I took a web development module where we were tasked with building an interactive web game called Snack Man using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, users could move the player around to collect points while avoiding collisions with enemies. The game featured a leaderboard that saved the highest scores, and players could control the game using on-screen buttons or their keyboard, with a live score display. Upon colliding with enemies, a life will be deducted from the initial three, and if the lives reached zero, the player would prompted to enter their name for the leaderboard, with scores saved using local storage. The development process went smoothly, thanks to our dedicated lecturer, who delivered engaging lectures and provided exceptional support to all students. His commitment to our success was commendable, and I felt privileged to learn from such an inspiring mentor.
                    </p>
                    <p>Key Game Features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Player Movement: Users can control the main character, navigating the game to collect points while avoiding enemies.</li>
                        <li>Collision Detection: The game features a system to detect collisions with enemies, deducting lives from the player. Each player starts with three lives, and upon losing all lives, a prompt appears to enter their name for the leaderboard.</li>
                        <li>Leaderboard: High scores are saved on a leaderboard using local storage, allowing players to see their ranking.</li>
                        <li>Control Options: Players can control the game using on-screen buttons or their keyboard, with a score display that updates live as they play.</li>
                    </ul>

                        Learning iOS development has truly excited me. I am a self-motivated individual when it comes to technology, and this enthusiasm opened my eyes to the world of iOS development. During my first-year summer holiday, I decided to take a YouTube course where I learned Swift and SwiftUI from scratch. I gained important knowledge about various aspects and tools of iOS development, including the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, Core Data for data persistence, and techniques for saving data in local storage using caching. I also became familiar with the Codable and Decodable protocols for encoding and decoding data.
                    </p>
                    <p>Projects in iOS:</p>

                        <li>Map App</li>
                        <li>Cryptocurrency App</li>
